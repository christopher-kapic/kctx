/**
 * Optional dead-man's-switch ping, sent by scripts/backup.sh after a dump has
 * been uploaded off-site.
 *
 * A backup cron that stops running produces no error anywhere. An external
 * monitor (healthchecks.io, Cronitor, Uptime Kuma push URL, or your own
 * endpoint) inverts that: it expects this GET on a schedule and alerts when it
 * stops arriving. So the ping means exactly one thing — "a dump landed in the
 * bucket" — and backup.sh only runs it after a successful upload.
 *
 * Failure here never fails the backup: the dump is already safe, and a missed
 * ping is self-correcting because the monitor raises the alarm on its own. So
 * every error path warns and exits 0.
 *
 * The URL usually embeds a secret token, so only its hostname is ever printed.
