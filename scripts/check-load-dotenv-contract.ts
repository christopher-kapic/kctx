/**
 * Guards the "validation vs loading" split in `packages/env`.
 *
 *   pnpm env:check-entrypoints   — verify (CI gate; non-zero exit on drift)
 *
 * Why this exists: `@starter/env/{shared,server,web,native}` validate
 * `process.env` and nothing else. They are imported by `@starter/auth` and
 * `@starter/db`, which the web SSR graph pulls in, so a single `import "dotenv"`
 * in one of them leaves `dotenv` as a Vite SSR runtime external — which is not
 * resolvable from `apps/web/dist/server/assets/` and takes production down. The
 * fix was to move all loading into `@starter/env/load-dotenv` (side effect) and
 * `@starter/env/root-env` (`loadRootDotenv()`), imported only from process
 * entrypoints. See patterns/environment-variables.md § Validation vs loading.
 *
 * That arrangement is invisible to typecheck, lint, and tests: every violation
 * of it still compiles and still passes locally, because locally a stray
 * `dotenv` always resolves. It only fails in a built container. So the rules are
 * asserted here instead.
 *
 * The invariants it enforces:
 *
 *   1. Every entrypoint in ENTRYPOINTS loads the root `.env`, in its declared
 *      mode. `sideEffect` entries must do it as their FIRST import — an import
 *      that drifts below `@starter/db` means validation runs before the file is
 *      read, which surfaces as a confusing "required env var" crash rather than
 *      as a missing import.
 *   2. No validation module imports `dotenv`, `./load-dotenv`, or `./root-env`.
 *      This is the rule whose violation broke production.
 *   3. Nothing outside DIRECT_DOTENV_ALLOWLIST imports `dotenv` directly. This
 *      is the straggler catcher: a new script that hand-rolls
 *      `dotenv.config({ path: "../../.env" })` gets its own root-resolution
 *      logic, which then rots independently of the shared one.
 *   4. The entrypoint table in patterns/environment-variables.md lists exactly
 *      the entrypoints declared here, so the human-readable half cannot drift
 *      from the enforced half.
 *
 * What it cannot tell you: whether a NEW process entrypoint was added and left
 * out of ENTRYPOINTS entirely. Nothing on disk distinguishes "a process
 * entrypoint" from "a module", so that judgment stays manual — but rule 3 means
 * the common way of getting it wrong (hand-rolling dotenv) is still caught.
 *
 * Dependency-free by design (node:fs only) — no new packages, safe to run in the
 * CI `lint` job alongside `pnpm env:check`.

 * import silently reintroduces the bug while still looking correct.

 * their bootstrap and their index.
 * `call` — `loadRootDotenv()`. For files that need to know WHICH keys the root
