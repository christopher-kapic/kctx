/**
 * Gate for the ordinary authenticated app (`_auth`: dashboard, settings).
 *
 * Deliberately checks only "is there a session" — NOT `emailVerified`, which
 * the admin guard below does check. That asymmetry is the template's
 * stance, not an oversight: **verification gates privilege escalation, not
 * basic use.** It mirrors the server, which is where the real boundary lives —
 * `protectedProcedure` has no verification check either, only `requireAdmin` /
 * `requireAdminOr404` does (`packages/api/src/index.ts`).
 * A guard here is UX; adding a check the procedures don't enforce would be
 * theater.
 *
 * Unverified sessions are reachable in practice, so this is load-bearing:
 * `requireEmailVerification` only governs email/password sign-in. SSO users are
 * created with whatever their IdP asserts in `email_verified`, defaulting to
 * `false` when the provider omits the claim (Entra ID, notably — Google, Okta,
 * and Keycloak do send it). Requiring verification here would lock every SSO
 * user out of the whole app on those providers.
 *
 * If your product genuinely requires verification for all access, do NOT just
 * add the check — returning `redirect-to-login` for an unverified session
 * bounces off `decideAnonymousOnlyRouteAccess` (which redirects any
 * authenticated visitor back) and loops forever. See
 * patterns/production-hardening.md § "Who email verification gates" for the
 * change that works.
