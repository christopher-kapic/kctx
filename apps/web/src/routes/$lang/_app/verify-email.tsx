/**
 * Landing page for the link in the account-verification email.
 *
 * The user does not arrive here directly: the emailed link points at
 * Better-Auth's `/api/auth/verify-email`, which validates the signed token,
 * flips `emailVerified`, and only then 302s here — carrying the `?ok=1` marker
 * `packages/auth` put on the callbackURL, plus `&error=<CODE>` when the token
 * was expired, malformed, or belongs to a user that no longer exists. So this
 * page never sees or handles a token, and there is nothing here an attacker
 * could replay.
 *
 * Three states, because this route is unguarded and directly navigable:
 *   • `?error=` → the link failed; offer a resend.
 *   • `?ok=1`   → came through a real verification hop; confirm it.
 *   • neither   → someone navigated here on their own (bookmark, back button,
 *     a guard bouncing an unverified user per patterns/production-hardening.md
 *     § Who email verification gates). We know nothing about their state, so
 *     we say so and offer a resend. Inferring success from the mere absence of
 *     `?error=` would tell an unverified user their address is confirmed and
 *     then bounce them at the login form.
 *
 * Verification deliberately does not create a session (Better-Auth's
 * `autoSignInAfterVerification` is left at its default `false`), so a forwarded
 * or leaked link can confirm an address but never hand out an account. The
 * success state therefore routes to sign-in — unless the visitor already has a
 * session, in which case we send them onward instead of bouncing them through a
 * login form they don't need.
 *
 * Unlike its siblings this route has no `beforeLoad` guard: it is a terminal
 * landing page that has to render for signed-out and signed-in visitors alike,
 * and an anonymous-only redirect would break the second case.
