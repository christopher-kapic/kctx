/**
 * True when a `/sign-in/email` response is a FAILED CREDENTIAL CHECK.
 *
 * 401 is Better-Auth's `INVALID_EMAIL_OR_PASSWORD` (`UNAUTHORIZED`). The
 * predicate is the security-critical part of this middleware, and 401-only is a
 * requirement, not precision for its own sake — every other plausible status is
 * a response that either fires BEFORE any password is read or means the
 * password was RIGHT:
 *
 *   - The 403 family is the trap. `/sign-in/email` declares
 *     `use: [formCsrfMiddleware]` (`sign-in.mjs:146`), so a `Cookie` with no
 *     (or `null`) `Origin` gets `MISSING_OR_NULL_ORIGIN`, a present-but-untrusted
 *     one gets `INVALID_ORIGIN`, and a cross-site navigation gets
 *     `CROSS_SITE_NAVIGATION_LOGIN_BLOCKED` — all BEFORE the password is read.
 *     Charging those hands anyone who knows an address an unauthenticated way to
 *     fill that address's failure bucket and 429 the victim out of their own
 *     login — the exact lever this counter's design exists to avoid; the same
 *     reasoning `signinSentMail` documents for the mail bucket. `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED`
 *     (also 403) means the password was CORRECT, and `BANNED_USER` (403) never
 *     checked it.
 *   - 400 is a malformed body — no account was consulted.
 *   - 200 is a success or a 2FA redirect — the credentials were right.
 *   - A 429 from the limiters mounted before this one is not a guess; charging
 *     it would double-count one attempt into two buckets.
 *
 * Re-check when bumping better-auth: a failure code that answers a different
 * status would silently stop being counted.

/**

 * rate-limit.ts for the budget, the anti-lever reasoning, and why it fails
 * open; see `signinFailedCredentials` for why only 401s charge.
 *
 * Charging is RESERVE-then-REFUND, the same deferred mode `emailRecipientLimit`
 * uses on this very route:
 *
 *   - A point is reserved BEFORE the handler, because consuming only after the
 *     response cannot bound concurrent guessing across replicas at all —
 *     N parallel wrong-password requests would all see a spare point.
 *   - The point is refunded unless the response is a 401, so a legitimate
 *     user's successful sign-ins (and every pre-password rejection above)
 *     leave no lasting charge. The reservation itself is held only for the
 *     length of the handler, and a password check is deliberately slow — an
 *     attacker can transiently saturate the bucket with in-flight attempts the
 *     same way they can `signinRecipientLimiter`'s; it decays the instant the
 *     flood stops, and bounding the flood is the point.
 *
 * Mounted AFTER the fail-closed IP-keyed credential pair (and after
 * `signinRecipientLimit`): its key is caller-supplied, so per the
 * one-bucket-per-surface rule in patterns/rate-limiting.md it must sit behind
 * a coarser, non-attacker-chosen control. A request 429'd by those never
 * reaches a password check, hence is never a 401, hence never charges here.
