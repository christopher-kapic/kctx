 *
 * The one to know about is `emailOTP` (not enabled here — see

 * it requires a session, so the per-user auth limiter covers it.
 *

 * metered elsewhere rather than by this middleware, because neither takes its
 * recipient from the request body:
 *
 *   - `/sign-in/email` mails only because `requireEmailVerification` and

 *   - `/two-factor/send-otp` mails to the address on the challenge, so this
 *     middleware cannot see the recipient at all. It gets its own
 *     challenge-keyed limiter in `two-factor-otp-limit.ts`.
 *
 * When auditing this set, read `packages/auth/src/index.ts` for flags and
 * callbacks that turn an ordinary endpoint into a mailer, not just the plugin
 * array — and remember a recipient does not have to arrive in the body.

 * (when `sendOnSignIn` is on) and throws `FORBIDDEN` / `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED`.
 *
 * It matches on the error CODE, not on the 403 status alone, and that is a
 * security requirement rather than precision for its own sake. Status alone is
 * WRONG here, and expensively so:
 *
 *   - `/sign-in/email` declares `use: [formCsrfMiddleware]` (`sign-in.mjs:146`).
 *   - `validateFormCsrf` → `validateOrigin` throws `FORBIDDEN` /
 *     `MISSING_OR_NULL_ORIGIN` for any request that carries a `Cookie` header
 *     with no (or a `null`) `Origin`, `INVALID_ORIGIN` for one that is present
 *     but untrusted, and `CROSS_SITE_NAVIGATION_LOGIN_BLOCKED` for
 *     `Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site` + `Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate`
 *     (`api/middlewares/origin-check.mjs:107,112,144`). Neither `skipCSRFCheck` nor
 *     `advanced.disableOriginCheck` is set in `packages/auth/src/index.ts`, so
 *     the check is live.
 *   - That 403 fires BEFORE the password is read. So a bare
 *     `status === 403` predicate charges a point for a request that needs no
 *     password, no existing account, and no mail — handing anyone who knows an
 *     address an unauthenticated way to fill that address's bucket and 429 the
 *     victim out of their own login. That is exactly the lockout the deferred
 *     mode exists to prevent, reintroduced through the predicate.
 *
 * `APIError.from()` puts `{ message, code }` in the body
 * (`@better-auth/core/dist/error/index.mjs`) and better-call serializes it as
 * the JSON response body (`to-response.mjs:127`), so the code is readable off a
 * clone without disturbing the response the client gets.
 *
 * The other 403 on this route — the admin plugin's `BANNED_USER`, thrown from
 * `session.create.before` — is likewise excluded, correctly: it sends no mail.
 *
 * Unparseable or non-JSON body → `false`, i.e. refund. On this predicate the
 * two error directions are not symmetric: failing to charge a real mail leaves
 * a mailer bounded by `credentialLimiter` and by the attacker needing a correct
 * password for an unverified account, whereas charging a non-mail response is
 * the lockout above. Refund is the safe direction.
 *
 * Re-check this function when bumping better-auth: a new code that DOES mail
 * would silently stop being metered.

 * not matter on the resend/reset/signup paths — there, naming a recipient IS
 * the request — but it is the whole ballgame on `/sign-in/email`.
 *
 * Why: the bucket is keyed on an address the CALLER supplies, and exhausting it
 * returns 429. On a path where every request costs a point, that hands anyone
 * who knows your email address an unauthenticated lever to lock you out of the
 * surface — and on sign-in the surface is *logging in*. Ten junk POSTs an hour
 * with a wrong password would have denied a verified user their own login, from
 * rotating IPs that the IP-keyed `credentialLimiter` cannot bound. That is a
 * strictly worse bug than the unmetered-mailer one this limiter exists to fix,
 * and it is the hazard the EMAIL family's code-fixed 0-second block already
 * warns about (see `emailRecipientLimiter`'s doc comment in rate-limit.ts),
 * applied to the worst possible endpoint.
 *
 * With a predicate, a verified user's sign-in leaves no LASTING charge: the
 * point is refunded as the response goes out, so only a mail-sending outcome
 * accumulates, and the only account that can be blocked long-term is one that is
 * unverified AND whose password the caller already has — an account that cannot
 * complete a sign-in anyway.
 *
 * "No lasting charge" is the accurate claim; "cannot be affected at all" is not.
 * The reservation below is held for the duration of the handler, and
 * `/sign-in/email` deliberately spends real time hashing the password. An
 * attacker holding `points` requests in flight against one address keeps that
 * bucket at its cap for as long as they sustain the concurrency, and a
 * legitimate sign-in arriving inside that window gets a 429. Each request
 * refunds on completion, so this decays the moment the flood stops — but it is a
 * live window, not a theoretical one, and rotating IPs evade the IP-keyed
 * `credentialLimiter` that would otherwise bound it. It is accepted because the
 * alternative (consume only after the handler) cannot bound concurrent sends
 * across replicas at all; see the reservation comment in the middleware.
 *
 * If you ever raise the recipient family's block above its code-fixed 0, note
 * it is shared with this limiter: the first overshoot calls `_block`, which
 * rewrites the key's TTL to the block duration, and a refund decrements the
 * counter without restoring the original window. That turns the transient
 * window above into a long one. Prefer 0 here.

 * `auth.handler(c.req.raw)` further down the chain, and reading the original
 * body here would hand it a spent stream. Same pattern as the ADMIN_EMAILS
 * bootstrap middleware in index.ts.
 *
 * This MUST classify a request exactly as better-call does, because BOTH
 * directions of a mismatch are bugs:
 *
 *   - Too permissive → we consume a point for a request Better-Auth then
 *     rejects. No mail is sent, but the victim's budget is spent anyway: an
 *     attacker could exhaust a real user's password-reset allowance without
 *     ever delivering a message.
 *   - Too restrictive → we skip a request Better-Auth goes on to honour. That
 *     is a full bypass of this limiter, i.e. the rotating-IP mail cannon.
 *
 * The second is how the earlier JSON-only version failed on `/sign-up/email`.
 *
 * The subtlety is that better-call applies THREE different tests, and mixing
 * them up reopens the bypass in one direction or the other:
 *
 *   - The 415 ACCEPTANCE gate matches on the media type's BASE
 *     (`normalizedContentType.split(";")[0].trim()`, `utils.mjs:11`).
 *   - The JSON test runs an ANCHORED regex over the FULL header (`utils.mjs:25`).
 *   - The urlencoded test runs `includes()` over the FULL header (`utils.mjs:34`).
 *
 * Anchoring is what makes the full-header JSON test safe. A loose `includes()`
 * there would reopen the bypass through a parameter:
 *
 *     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset="application/json"
 *
 * — a substring check sees "application/json", tries `.json()`, fails, and waves
 * the request through, while Better-Auth parses the form body and sends the mail.
 * The anchored regex correctly declines to match that header, and the urlencoded
 * branch below then handles it, exactly as better-call does.
 *
 * The urlencoded branch uses `includes()` on the full header purely to mirror
 * better-call. It is NOT load-bearing for security. The asymmetry between the two
 * branches reads like a bypass, so the reasoning is recorded here:
 *
 *     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencodedx
 *
 * — this passes the acceptance gate (whose own `includes()` is on the base), fails
 * the anchored JSON regex, and reaches the urlencoded branch. A strict
 * `base === "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"` would NOT match it, so the request
 * would fall through to "no recipient" and consume no point. That looks like a free
 * signup flood — but it isn't, because `Request.formData()` rejects any body whose
 * MIME *essence* is not exactly `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or
 * `multipart/form-data`. Better-call calls the very same `request.formData()`, and
 * its urlencoded branch has no try/catch, so that header throws there too and no
 * mail is ever sent. Every header that CLEARS THE ACCEPTANCE GATE and on which
 * strict-base and loose-full disagree is a header `formData()` refuses; every such
 * header `formData()` accepts has an essence the strict check already matched. The
 * two are therefore equivalent in outcome.
 *
 * The acceptance-gate qualifier is load-bearing, not throat-clearing. Without it
 * the claim is false — `multipart/form-data; boundary=application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
 * has a base of `multipart/form-data` (strict fails), contains the urlencoded
 * substring (loose matches), and `formData()` parses it happily. It is harmless
 * only because the gate 415s it first: the base contains neither allowed media
 * type. So the equivalence holds for the paths this middleware is mounted on, and
 * would NOT survive someone widening `allowedMediaTypes` to include multipart.
 * If that ever happens, parse multipart here too rather than reasoning again.
 *
 * Mirroring better-call exactly is still the right call — it removes a class of
 * divergence that only stays harmless as long as `formData()` keeps refusing those
 * essences — but do not read this branch as the thing standing between you and a
 * mail cannon. The acceptance gate and `signupRecipientLimiter` are.
 *
 * So: split for the acceptance gate, but match the FULL header for both parse
 * branches, with better-call's own anchored regex and `includes()`, in its order.
 *
 * Exported because `signin-failure-limit.ts` needs the SAME exact
 * classification on `/sign-in/email` (which accepts form-urlencoded as well as
 * JSON): the failure counter must see every encoding Better-Auth will, or an
 * attacker switches encoding and the per-account ceiling evaporates.
