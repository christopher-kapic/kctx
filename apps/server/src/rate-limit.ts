 *
 * `credentialLimiter`/`credentialBurstLimiter` key on client IP, which is the
 * right default but is exactly the control a rotating-IP stuffing campaign
 * defeats: a botnet with N source addresses gets N × 10 guesses per minute at
 * the ONE account it is working on, bounded after that only by
 * `minPasswordLength` and 2FA. This bucket counts FAILED sign-in attempts per
 * EMAIL, so the ceiling follows the account under attack rather than the
 * address the attack comes from. It applies ONLY to
 * `POST /api/auth/sign-in/email` — never to signup or password reset, which
 * stay IP-keyed (they cannot fail a credential check, so there is nothing to
 * count, and a per-email counter on them is pure lockout lever).
 *
 * Why this does not recreate the hazard that keeps `emailRecipientLimiter`'s
 * blockDuration at 0 (see its doc comment). That hazard is about buckets
 * charged per ATTEMPT: four anonymous POSTs naming a victim would deny them a
 * password reset at no skill and no cost, because naming the address IS the
 * request. This bucket is charged per FAILED CREDENTIAL VERIFICATION — a point
 * lands only when Better-Auth actually ran the password check and it did not
 * match, and successful sign-ins are refunded. An attacker who knows only the
 * address can still fill it by submitting wrong passwords; that is inherent to
 * any per-account failure counter. The residual lever is what the numbers are
 * for: at 10 failures / 15 min → 10-minute block, the worst a campaign can do
 * is blip a victim's login for ten minutes at a time, while the campaign
 * itself is capped at 10 password checks per 15 minutes per email no matter
 * how many IPs it holds. Do not lengthen either window without re-reading this
 * paragraph. rate-limiter-flexible applies the block TTL on the first overshoot
 * only, so retrying while blocked does not extend the sentence.
 *
 * Keys are `signinFailureKey(email)` — a SHA-256 of the normalized address,
 * never the raw email — hashed so the credential never reaches Redis keys
 * tokens: a raw address in the key would put a reusable, correlateable
 * identifier into Redis key-space, `KEYS` dumps, and slow-logs for the life of
 * the window.
 *
 * Fail-OPEN with in-memory insurance, like the general surfaces — unlike the
 * IP-keyed credential pair this sits behind. Those fail closed because losing
 * them silently reopens the stuffing hole; this layer is enforced ON TOP of a
 * pair that is still fail-closed on the very same route, so a Redis outage
 * degrades sign-in to exactly the pre-this-limiter posture rather than to
 * nothing. Failing closed here would instead 503 one account's sign-in because
 * a counter about it could not be read — the lockout lever again, powered by an
 * outage instead of an attacker.

 * taken from the request body.
 *
 * Weaker than the other two by construction: Better-Auth validates the password
 * before mailing, so an attacker cannot aim this at an arbitrary mailbox — only
 * at one whose credentials they already hold. That is why the budget is the most
 * generous of the three and why `credentialLimiter` remains the real control
 * here. What this bucket stops is the leaked-credential mail loop: a stuffing
 * run that happens to hold a valid password for an unverified account would
 * otherwise mail that address once per attempt, from as many IPs as it likes.

 * response says mail actually went out. Read the `ConsumeWhen` doc comment in
 * `email-recipient-limit.ts` before changing that: on a bucket keyed by a
 * caller-supplied address, charging every attempt turns this limiter into an
 * unauthenticated lockout lever aimed at the login page itself — a worse bug
 * than the unmetered mailer it exists to bound. Verified users' sign-ins leave no
 * LASTING charge: the point is refunded as the response goes out. They can still
 * occupy the bucket for as long as they are in flight, so a sustained flood of
 * concurrent sign-in attempts against one address can transiently 429 that

/**
 * Two-factor OTP limiter — caps resends per two-factor CHALLENGE.
 *
 * `/api/auth/two-factor/send-otp` is the fourth recipient-controlled mailer, and

 * mints a code, and mails it — with **no per-challenge cap of any kind**
 * (`two-factor/otp/index.mjs:67-91`). The challenge cookie is only consumed on a
 * *successful* verification, so a single signed cookie can be replayed
 * indefinitely, and every replay puts another mail in the owner's inbox.
 *
 * That makes it cheaper than the sign-in mailer this file's other comment
 * describes: sign-in costs a full password verification per mail, this costs one
 * replayed cookie. The only ceiling today is the IP-keyed credential pair, which
 * is exactly what rotating IPs defeat.
 *
 * Keyed on the CHALLENGE, not the recipient, and that choice is what makes this

 *   - It bounds precisely the cheap part. Exceeding the budget forces the caller
