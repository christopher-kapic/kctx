    // second account while signed into a first. (A signed-out or expired session
    // cookie does not do it: Better-Auth deletes the cookie on sign-out and
    // matches its max-age to the session's expiry, so the browser stops sending
    // it.) Deliberately not "fixed" by charging one point for the whole request:
    // whichever cookie you picked to charge, the other becomes a free bucket, and
    // that is the bypass this loop exists to close. If the case ever shows up in
