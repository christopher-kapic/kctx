  // reading is wrong. It does NOT close the 60s cookie-cache window: on a cache
  // hit `getSession` returns the cached user verbatim without touching the DB,
  // so `banned` is the stale pre-ban value and this check sees false. What
  // actually closes that window is that both ban paths delete the session rows,
  // so once the cache lapses the request 401s anyway.

  // a direct DB update, a future admin path that forgets to, or a session minted
  // between the two statements. Defense in depth.
