// Resolves the Better-Auth session once per request and stashes it on the
// Hono context. Downstream consumers (rate limiter, oRPC createContext, the
// /sw/push-renew handler) read `c.get("session")` instead of each making
// their own database hit.
//
// Failure mode: a Better-Auth blip becomes "no session" rather than a 500
// for the entire request. The downstream `requireAuth` gates will still
// return 401 if a real session was needed.
//
// SECURITY: `Authorization` is stripped before resolving, so the routes this
// middleware guards (/rpc/*, /api/assets/*, /api/images/*,
// /sw/*) authenticate by cookie ONLY.
//
// Defense in depth. This template ships no bearer-token credential, but a
// Better-Auth plugin that adds one (API keys, OAuth access tokens) typically
// mocks a session for the credential's owner inside `getSession` — and no oRPC
// procedure here checks a credential's scope. Stripping the header keeps that
// from silently turning these cookie surfaces into token surfaces. A future
// bearer surface should resolve and scope-check its own credential rather than
// relax this.
