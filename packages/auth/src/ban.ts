/**
 * Ban-state predicate, shared by every surface that authenticates without going
 * through Better-Auth's own session-creation path.
 *
 * It lives here, dependency-free, so that every surface which re-implements the
 * admin rules for its own credential type applies an identical check. The
 * Better-Auth plugin gate (`apps/server/src/admin-session-gate.ts`) is the
 * current caller; keep new credential-resolving surfaces on this predicate
 * rather than re-deriving the ban rule.
 *
 * Why any of them need it: the admin plugin only rejects a banned user when a
 * session is CREATED (`session.create.before`). It never re-checks on
 * `getSession`, and with the 60s cookie cache an already-issued session keeps
 * working for up to a minute after a ban. Credentials that are not sessions at
 * all — an API key row, a device token — are never re-checked by the plugin on
 * any request. `users.archive` therefore sets `banned` AND deletes sessions AND
 * disables API keys, and these gates close the remaining windows.

  // defensive padding: on a Better-Auth cookie-cache HIT the session user is

  // into Dates (`better-auth/dist/api/routes/session.mjs:110-114`), so
  // `banExpires` arrives as an ISO string. Calling `.getTime()` on it throws a
  // TypeError, which — for a LAPSED ban, where the correct answer is "allow" —
  // turned a legitimate admin's request into a 500 until the cache expired.
