/**
 * Where the emailed verification link lands the user after Better-Auth has
 * validated the token server-side.
 *
 * Better-Auth builds the emailed URL as
 * `${baseURL}/verify-email?token=<jwt>&callbackURL=<encoded>` and, in its
 * `/verify-email` handler, 302s to that `callbackURL` — bare on success, or
 * with `?error=<CODE>` appended (`TOKEN_EXPIRED`, `INVALID_TOKEN`,
 * `USER_NOT_FOUND`) when the token doesn't check out. Without a `callbackURL`
 * the caller-supplied default is `/`, which dumps a freshly-verified user on
 * the marketing home page with no confirmation that anything happened.
 *
 * We rewrite it here rather than passing `callbackURL` from each caller so
 * every path that mails a verification link — signup, the resend endpoint, a
 * future admin-triggered re-send — lands on the same page without having to
 * remember to opt in.
 *
 * The destination carries an explicit `?ok=1` marker. Absence of `?error=` is
 * NOT a usable success signal on its own: `/$lang/verify-email` is an
 * unguarded, directly-navigable route, so a bare visit (bookmark, back button,
 * a guard redirect for an unverified user) would otherwise render as
 * "verified". Better-Auth appends its failure code with `&` when the
 * callbackURL already has a query string, so `?ok=1&error=TOKEN_EXPIRED` is
 * the shape of a failed hop — the page treats any `error` as authoritative.
 *
 * A caller-supplied `callbackURL` is preserved *if it is safe*. Better-Auth
 * routes the change-email confirmation chain through this same hook and
 * re-encodes the pending `callbackURL` into a second-hop token URL; clobbering
 * it would strand that flow on the signup confirmation page. But that value is
 * also attacker-reachable — `POST /api/auth/send-verification-email` accepts a
 * `callbackURL` in its body — so anything that isn't a same-origin relative
 * path or an explicitly allowed origin is discarded in favour of the default.
 * Better-Auth applies its own `originCheck` on top of this; the check here is
 * deliberately redundant so a regression upstream, or a wildcard added to
 * `trustedOrigins`, can't turn a verification email into an open redirect.
 *
 * `appOrigin` is where the *web app* lives, which is not always where this API
 * lives. Better-Auth resolves a relative `callbackURL` against the API host, so
 * on a split-origin deploy (`CORS_ORIGIN` set — api.example.com serving
 * example.com) a relative path would land the user on the API hostname: wrong
 * cookie scope, wrong canonical URL, and a route the API doesn't serve. Pass
 * the web origin there and the callback is emitted absolute. Omit it for a
 * same-origin deploy and the callback stays relative, as before.
 *
 * The path is built from a locale we narrow ourselves against
 * `SUPPORTED_LOCALES`, never from user input.
