/**
 * One "email me a code" click is one point. 5 / 600 s covers that click, a
 * couple of retries when SMTP is flaky (the reason the preflight exists), and
 * a colleague or two behind shared egress — while cutting what one anonymous
 * IP can extract from the shared `/rpc` limiter's 100/min (~6,000 SMTP
 * handshakes per hour) to 30.
 *
 * Fail-CLOSED, per the procedure-budget contract: fail-open is "never for
 * spend, mail, or unbounded writes", and each point here opens a real
 * outbound SMTP connection and confirms to an anonymous caller that email is
 * configured. Apply the doc's ten-minute test: losing this bucket for ten
 * minutes during a Redis blip would hand an anonymous client exactly the
 * unbounded SMTP-probe surface this budget exists to close. The availability
 * cost is contained — both callers (web login, native sign-in) catch any
 * thrown error and degrade to `{ ok: false }`, the user is told the code
 * could not be sent, and TOTP verification keeps working for the outage.
 * Like the other strict limiters it carries no insurance backstop: a
 * per-process ceiling is not a real bound across a scaled fleet, and here it
 * would be precisely the thing letting SMTP probes through.
