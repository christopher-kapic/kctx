 *
 * Why this exists rather than being inlined at each call site: two posts titled
 * "Welcome" is not an edge case, it is Tuesday. Without a collision step the
 * second create fails on the unique constraint and surfaces to the author as an
 * opaque error about a field they never filled in.
 *
 * This is best-effort, not atomic: two concurrent creates can both observe the
 * same slug as free. Keep the `@unique` constraint on the column and handle the
 * P2002 error as a CONFLICT — this function reduces collisions to a rare race
 * rather than a routine failure. `packages/api/src/routers/cms/posts.ts` shows
 * the P2002 → CONFLICT half (client-supplied slug); wire `uniqueSlug` at create
 * time when the server derives the slug from a title.
 *
 * @param base     Output of `slugify()`. Empty input falls back to `fallback`.
 * @param exists   Returns true when the candidate is already taken.
 * @param fallback Used when `base` is empty (e.g. an all-emoji title).
