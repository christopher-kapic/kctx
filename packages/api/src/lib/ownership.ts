 * Run an owner-scoped lookup and collapse a miss into NOT_FOUND.

 * The owner clause is a REQUIRED argument that this helper merges into the

 * read as "ownership checked" at the call site while the actual check lived in
 * a `where` the caller could simply forget — an IDOR that looks correct in
 * review.
 *
 * The merge is `AND`-composed rather than spread into the caller's `where`, so
 * neither a caller key of the same name nor a caller `OR` can widen it away.
 *
 * NOT_FOUND rather than FORBIDDEN is deliberate: a row that exists but belongs
 * to someone else must be indistinguishable from a row that does not exist, or
 * the error code itself becomes an existence oracle.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const row = await findOwnedOrThrow({
 *   find: (args) => prisma.pushSubscription.findFirst(args),
 *   args: { where: { id: input.id }, select: { id: true } },
 *   owner: { field: "userId", id: context.session.user.id },
