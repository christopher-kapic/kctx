// Named rate-limit budgets — the five-family collapse.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// One POINTS/DURATION/BLOCK_DURATION knob per limiter would be a tuning
// surface for someone who has read this file, and an unsortable wall for
// everyone else — and per-surface knobs invite the one mistake
// patterns/rate-limiting.md exists to prevent: squeezing one budget to "be
// safe" and locking out a shared office, instead of SPLITTING the surface
// that needs its own bucket.
//
// Instead there are five named budgets, two knobs each: AUTH, RPC, UPLOAD,
// EMAIL, CHAT. Semantics: a budget describes its family's REFERENCE
// member; every other member keeps its ratio to that reference, so setting a
// budget re-tunes the whole family coherently.
//
//   • POINTS multiplies every member's points by (provided / reference).
//   • WINDOW_SECONDS multiplies every member's window AND block duration by
//     (provided / reference window) — the window:block ratio is part of each
//     member's design and moves as a unit.
//
// What deliberately does NOT become env-tunable: the burst/sustained pairing
// (a member's ratio to its reference), the key each bucket is keyed on, and
// fail-open vs fail-closed. Those are security design, not capacity planning.
// The signin-failure triple stays code-only for the same reason (see its doc
// comment in apps/server/src/rate-limit.ts).
//
// With every budget left at its default the multipliers are exactly 1 and
// every limiter runs at its shipped reference numbers.
