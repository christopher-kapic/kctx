/**
 * Pure helpers for locating and loading the repository-root `.env`.
 *
 * Nothing in this module runs at import time. Importing it has no effect on
 * `process.env` — that is the whole point of keeping it separate from
 * `./load-dotenv`, which is the side-effect entry:
 *
 * - `./load-dotenv` — `import "@starter/env/load-dotenv";` as the FIRST import
 *   of a process entrypoint. Side effect only, exports nothing.
 * - `./root-env` (this file) — for callers that need to know WHICH keys the
 *   file supplied (see `LoadRootDotenvResult.parsed`). The one such caller today
 *   is `apps/web/vite.config.ts`.
 *
 *   `packages/db/prisma.config.ts` is NOT an example of this, despite looking
 *   like one: it imports `dotenv` directly and must keep doing so. It is loaded
 *   by `prisma generate` during `pnpm install`, before any workspace source
 *   exists in the Docker build context, so routing it through this module breaks
 *   both image builds — a failure `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, and typecheck all
 *   miss. `scripts/check-load-dotenv-contract.ts` allowlists it deliberately.
 *
 * Either way the rule from `./load-dotenv` still holds: only process
 * entrypoints load. The validation modules (`./shared`, `./server`, `./web`,
 * `./native`) must never import this file — they run inside the production
 * server bundle and the web SSR graph, which must stay free of `dotenv`.
 * `pnpm env:check-entrypoints` enforces both halves of that contract.
